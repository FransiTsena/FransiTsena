<h1 align="center">Hey there I’m Fransi Tsena ⚡</h1>
<h3 align="center">Builder of digital worlds, breaker of comfort zones, DevOps artisan</h3>


Some people collect stamps. I collect **systems**.  
Give me a blank repo, and I’ll spin it into a resilient, scalable, CI/CD’d, containerized microverse.

I’ve spent years floating between clouds (AWS, GCP), scripting thoughts into code (Python, Go), and shipping products that don’t just work, they *thrive under pressure*. Sometimes I go deep with Dart and Flutter, other times I'm surfing async waves in TypeScript.  
I don't pick favorites — I pick the right tool and bend it to my will.

I believe that **elegant architecture is invisible**, just like great design.  
Also, dark themes. Always.

🧠 **My Code Philosophy**

> *Knowledge is potential. But implementation? That’s kinetic energy.*  
> I’ve seen geniuses frozen by theory, and quiet coders changing the game by doing.  
> I live in that gap — where action meets understanding.

⚙️ **The Tech I Use Doesn't Define Me, But Here's a Taste:**

I’ve containerized code while sipping coffee, provisioned entire infra before my pizza got cold, and built frontends that load faster than your favorite anime intro.  
I’m as comfortable optimizing Docker images as I am tuning cloud cost reports or wiring WebSocket events in a real-time Flutter app.

🎮 **What I'm Currently Into**  
- Playing with AI agents like they’re my new dev team  
- Automating infrastructure to the point it feels like witchcraft  
- Tinkering with edge deployments just because I can  
- Watching anime with my terminal open (yes, it's a vibe)
